# Gogol
Script-free playground for creating games

## Goal
Gogol is an experimental project of mine which I develop in my free time as a hobby. It shouldn't not be taken as a game maker but rather than a playground to express creativity and for fun.

The goals are:
* Drang 'n drop
* Script-free
* The main platform are tablets devices
* Should be easy to dive in
* Not a "game engine/editor" or "Sketch" replacement, rather a playgorund.
* Provide many usable free assets.
* Share works in Gogols built-in community


## Status
Gogol is currently WIP and unusable, no ETA for a working version.
Currently it lacks a runner/interpreter of projects created with editor, events editor and some editor features. When things get clearer, will do a proper TODO list.

* Editor - partial
* File format - partial
* Events - not started
* Runner - not started
